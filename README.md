This game is a fresh, modern spin on the classic logic puzzle, Minesweeper. It’s all about uncovering tiles on a board and using numbers to deduce where hidden mines are buried. With each move, your logic and attention to detail are put to the test. Easy to pick up, but endlessly challenging, Minesweeper is perfect for quick rounds or diving deep into brain-teasing puzzles solo or with friends.



A clean, simple interface that’s easy to use. Customizable board sizes, so you can play different levels. A Java-based GUI using Swing for smooth, responsive gameplay. Dive in, have fun!
